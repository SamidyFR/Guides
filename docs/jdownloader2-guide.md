# *How to Install and Debloat JDownloader 2*

*This guide will teach you how to fully install and debloat JDownloader 2, a software that splits the file you want to download to make the download speeds much faster (a goal similar to IDM). Alright, let's begin!*

### *Installation*

You'll need to go to [the JDownloader download page](https://jdownloader.org/jdownloader2), click on your operating system and choose the specific version of the software. You'll be led to a MEGA page from where the setup file should start downloading after you click on the `Download Installer (x[Y], Java [Z])` button. Once it's done, you'll notice a separate download starting. From there, save the file, run it and follow the installation instructions. It will take some time to fully install.

### *Debloating*

1.  Once finished installing the software, open it and click on `Settings` (located at the top-left corner of the screen) → `Settings` → **(⚠️) Advanced Settings** (located at the left side of the screen). If prompted, click on `Ok` (and check the `Don't show this again` checkbox to disable the prompt in the future - Optional). In `Filters Settings`, search for the following and disable all of them:
    1.  `Premium Alert` (uncheck all of the checkboxes that appear)
    2.  `Oboom` (If prompted, check the `Don't show this again` checkbox and click on `Ok`)
    3.  `Special Deals`
    4.  `Donate` (change the value from `Visible (Automode)` to `Hidden (Automode)`)
    5.  `Banner`
2.  Once done, close the app (If prompted, click on `Exit JDownloader`. (Optionally, check the `Don't show this again` checkbox and select either `Minimize to Taskbar` or `Hide to Tray` to set it up for later use. Then, manually close the app.))

Enjoy your new ad-free JDownloader!

### *Troubleshooting Tips*

If you encounter any issues during the installation or debloating process, here are some common solutions:

-   **Installation Issues**: If the installer fails to run, make sure that you have the required permissions or try running it as an administrator.
-   **Settings Not Saving**: If the changes don't appear to be saving, restart the application and then try again.
