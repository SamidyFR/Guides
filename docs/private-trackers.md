### *Introducing RED*
![Redacted | RED | Music](https://i.imgur.com/F9uUfUT.png)

> **Note:** Redacted - Largest private music tracker at 2.2 million+ torrents.

The best way is to join RED via IRC. The prep site is [here](https://interviewfor.red/en/index.html)

The interview is conducted like an online exam. They ask you to close everything but IRC and screenshot your desktop. You aren't supposed to look at the prep material. The prep site is monitored, if you try to cheat they will see your IP connecting. They'll stop the interview and ask you to admit to cheating. If you mess up you can try again the next day. If you lie they'll permaban you.

Next reach the `Elite` userclass and get invited to other trackers from the forums.
The requirements for this are 50 uploads, 3 months of account age and 100GB of upload.

> **Note:** RED has by far the best invite forum for new users.

The goal now should be to join PTP, when it opens again. In the meantime, join the trackers you want and try to get the `Elite` equivalent userclass there too.

After getting on PTP your goal is likely BTN. Last time they recruited they wanted 15 uploads, get at least this many.

> **Note:** If a tracker is not recruiting on one of the 4 core cabal trackers (PTP/BTN/HDB/RED) there's a good chance they are not recruiting anywhere.

> **Other info:**
> - If you don't have PTP/BTN you'll need a mix of trackers to get maximum coverage. Your best bet is to get yourself a few HD trackers. BHD/BLU/UHDB will get the job done.
> - At least one general tracker, usually IPT but FL or TL will do.
> - Whatever niche trackers you can get your hands on, such as TVV for television and CG, SC, THC for movies.
> - Most importantly, regional trackers.

### *Glossary*
#### *Cabal*
CABAL refers to groups of trackers who work together to share user information. RED, PTP, BTN and HDB are the core of cabal.

#### *Treeban*
Treebanning is when admins look at a users invite tree and bans them all.

> **Note:** Don't sweat too much though, admins in the past have treebanned people, but if you have a history of being a good user and are only tangentially related to the people who triggered the treeban you will probably get your account reactivated.

#### *Dead end trackers*
Dead end trackers are those which have useless or non existent invite forums.
