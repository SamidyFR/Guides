# About & Policy

### *My stance*

I've **never** and will **never** use AI for writing anything. So, that means, even if it's a full re-write, **I'll write everything myself.** I hate AI; it takes human creativity and turns it into "language models" to spew out some garbage that's "new" and "better," whereas even now, you can easily find errors in AI-generated trash.

*(Also yes, all of these guides are owned and maintained by me and me only. I love pain.)*

### *My Current Thoughts*

### *My Permanent Thoughts*

1.  *For future reference:* **Don't try to contact me if you're just going to randomly ghost me without saying anything. It makes you look like a piece of shit. If you don't like talking to me, say it outright instead of being a bitch about it.**

2.  ~*The guy who ghosted me #1 (update):*~

    (I no longer give a fuck about that bitch. My Discord username is **claraiscutelol**. Do not message me or send me a friend request if you're only there to ghost me. **I WON'T BE TOLERATING THIS.**)

3.  If you do send me messages or friend requests, I'll **only** be accepting it **if** we know each other (either from a server or me **knowing you** IRL). So, don't expect me to say "Hi" to you if we've never even talked.

    (The only exception to this is if it's a really important message, in which case, I'll respond.)
