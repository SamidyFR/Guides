# *Avoid GShade, use normal ReShade instead*

The developer of GShade added code to reboot your computer if you used a third party app to manage updates as a form of "anti-tamper". Malicious behavior, but then admitted to it, [claimed it was the users fault for triggering it and that the included payload could be worse](https://files.catbox.moe/sj9mfi.jpeg). The app stopped working when they were kicked off of GitHub. For some reason, a free cosmetic mod needed DRM. 

It is back online now, though you should stick to stock ReShade instead.
