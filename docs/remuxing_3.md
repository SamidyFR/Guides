### *Method #3 (using MakeMKV)*

1.  Open MakeMKV. Select the `index.bdmv` file from the BDMV folder of your Blu-ray.

2.  Uncheck any unwanted playlists. In the track list, deselect any tracks you do not want in the final output (e.g., extra audio commentaries, unnecessary subtitles).

3.  Start the backup process to create an MKV file.

4.  Open the resulting MKV file in MKVToolNix. Reorder tracks, edit track titles and languages, and make any other necessary changes as described in the [eac3to](remuxing_1#method-1-using-eac3to) guide (follow from step 7 to step 10). Remuxing again with MKVToolNix does not cause any quality loss.

!!! MakeMKV is highly recommended for handling Dolby Vision Profile 7 (p7) video. A common workflow is to extract the video track using MakeMKV, extract and process the audio/subtitles using eac3to, and then mux everything together in MKVToolNix.
