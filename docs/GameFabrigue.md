# *GameFabrigue is garbage*

### *Context*
GameFabrique has adware installers which open a magnet link in your torrent client. The torrents tend to be from untrusted sources like igg-games.

### *Testing*
I ran it through a sandbox a couple times, you can see what happened here:

1. https://app.any.run/tasks/f7b7aa9e-a4bc-4466-b342-6bdf3ec35593
2. https://app.any.run/tasks/de442e3d-c3fc-453f-9a82-345a3655c933

### *Results*
In each installer, AVG secure browser and McAfee web advisor were installed onto the machine. Keep in mind that any.run flags minor things as "malicious activity", though they do bundle adware into their installers and link to torrents from untrusted sources.
