# *How to Bypass Loot-Link URL*

---

### *Introduction*

> **Note: Why?**  
> The site tries to download the Opera browser from the 'Download the Best Gaming Browser' text to show the URL, you can continue when you enter the site from the Opera browser. This is annoying for many people. But there is a way to bypass this, which is to show the site that you are using the Opera browser.

> **Warning: Potential Annoyance**  
> If you have an ad blocker or popup blocker, you need to disable them. Not completely, only in the site.
