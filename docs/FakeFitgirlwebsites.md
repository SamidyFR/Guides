![Example of the hosts file](https://files.catbox.moe/hxznxr.png)

##### *Method 2*
If you don't feel comfortable editing text files, you can use [Microsoft PowerToys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/install) for the [Hosts File Editor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/hosts-file-editor) to edit the hosts file using a program. Here's how:

1. Go to the [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/latest) or to the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=XP89DCGQ3K6VLD) and install PowerToys from there.

> **Info: You can also use winget (if installed) to install PowerToys with the following command in Powershell.**
> `winget install Microsoft.PowerToys --source winget`

2. After installing & launching PowerToys, you will be greeted with a screen like this:

6. Repeat Step 3 and 4 with the next fake website.

#### *FitGirl Installer*

Most of FitGirl's installers come with the "Redirect fake FitGirl sites to the real one" checkbox after each installation. Make sure to checkmark it to prevent accidentally going to fake websites!
