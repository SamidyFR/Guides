# Qoob is garbage

Qoob was the name that Seyter switched to after being called out for malware. Qoob's repacks are also banned on rutracker for [weird installer behavior](https://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=76324722). I don't think the repacks have malware in them, but I felt like it was worth mentioning.
